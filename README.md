# zsh-eza-ls-plugin

This zsh plugin enables a number of aliases allowing `eza`, to act as a drop-in
replacement for `ls` and `tree`.

This plugin is inspired by [MohamedElashri/exa-zsh](https://github.com/MohamedElashri/exa-zsh)
and [zpm-zsh/ls](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/ls)

Due to exa is unmaintained, we use the [fork eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) instead.

## Installation
